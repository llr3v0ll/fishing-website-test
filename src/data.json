Like the VanDam original, it'll bounce and deflect off cover, constantly wandering with an erratic searching action while still running true; that's enough to spur most bass into action. But this Hard Knock version replaces the standard BB rattles with a single large knocker ball, and the deep, reverberating thud it emits is unlike that of any other bait. It speaks to bass on a primal level, and they respond – simple as that. Also great when long, accurate, water-covering casts are needed."
